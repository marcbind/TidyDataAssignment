# The Task(s):
# 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#
# First lets use feature.txt to provide good names to the columns
# of the X_test/train data and to select which columns we want.

features <- read.table("features.txt", colClasses = "character")[, "V2"]

# The feature names are chosen reasonably by the original authors
# and we keep the upper/lowercase. I do remove the brackets (
# and ) though and replace comma and hyphen with underscore.
# Remember: beauty is in the eye of the beholder ;-)

# Part of this task is to extract only the measurements on the mean
# and standard deviation for each measurement. We create a logical
# vector by searching for Variable names that contain "-mean" or
# "-std" (which after our translation is "_mean", "_std").
# Note 1:
# This is removing the last few variables like "angle(X,gravityMean)".
# If these should be contained we can simply remove the underscore
# in the grepl pattern.
# Note 2:
# For simplicity/readability we do restrict the logical vector further,
# to the "original" variables, i.e. basic Acceleration and Gyroscope
# data in the time ("t") domain.
# The code further down below is generic and the selection is solely
# controlled by is_mean_std.
